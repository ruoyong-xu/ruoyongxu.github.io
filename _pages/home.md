# Hi, welcome!
I am currently employed as a statistician at Pharmaron. 

I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Patrick Brown. Prior to that, I completed my BSc in Mathematics at Shanghai University, followed by an MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto. 

Since March 2024, I have been working as a part-time researcher with Prof. Patrick Brown and am open to research opportunities in applied statistics and software development. 


## Research
My PhD work involves development of R softwares using GPU’s parallel computing power and statistical computing methods in geostatsistical models.
My main interests include deep learning, statistical software, and computational statistics. Additionally, I am intrigued by inference problems within statistical methods in medical research.

## Software
* [clrng](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/clrng): an R package built as a tool set for random number generation on GPUs in R. This package is dependent on the [gpuR](https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR) package and utilize the MRG31k3p RNG from the clRNG, an OpenCL library by Pierre L’Ecuyer. Contributors for this package are Ruoyong Xu and Patrick Brown.

* [gpuBatchMatrix](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/gpuBatchMatrix): an R package that does several matrix operations that are useful in geostatistical model computations in batches on GPU in R. Contributors for this packages are Patrick Brown and Ruoyong Xu.

* [gpuLik](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/gpuLik): an R package that computes profile likelihoods for linear geostatistical models on GPUs.
