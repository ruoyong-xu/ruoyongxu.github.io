# Hi, welcome!
I am currently employed as a statistician at Pharmaron. 

I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Patrick Brown. Prior to that, I completed my BSc in Mathematics at Shanghai University, followed by an MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto. 

Since March 2024, I have been working as a part-time researcher with Prof. Patrick Brown and am open to research opportunities and collaboration in applied statistics and software development. 


## Research
My PhD work involves development of R softwares using GPU’s parallel computing power and statistical computing methods in geostatsistical models.
My main interests include deep learning, statistical software, and computational statistics. Additionally, I am intrigued by inference problems within statistical methods in medical research.

## Software
* [clrng](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/clrng): builds on gpuR and utilizes the clRNG ('OpenCL') library to provide efficient tools to generate random numbers in parallel on a GPU and save the results as R objects, and ensuring high-quality random numbers even when R is used interactively or in an ad-hoc manner.
  
* [gpuBatchMatrix](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/gpuBatchMatrix): an R package that performs parallel batch matrix operations on GPU, particularly tailored for geostatistical model evaluations.

* [gpuLik](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/gpuLik): leverages GPUs for parallel computation of profile likelihoods, specifically designed for Gaussian spatial models.
