I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. My academic advisor is Prof. Patrick Brown. My PhD work involves development of statistical softwares using GPU's in R and statistical computing in geostatsistical models. I formerly did my BSc in Mathematics in Shanghai University, and MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto. 


## Research
My reaserach interests lie in Statistical Software, Spatial statistics. I am also interested in learning neural networks.


## Statistical papers
Ruoyong Xu, Patrick Brown, Pierre L’Ecuyer (2022). A tool set for random number generation on GPUs in R. Submitted.

## Working papers
Ruoyong Xu, Patrick Brown (2022). Profile likelihoods for geostatsistical models using GPU's.


## Software
* [clrng](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/clrng): an R package built as a tool set for random number generation on GPUs in R. This package is dependent on the [gpuR](https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR) package and utilize the MRG31k3p RNG from the clRNG, an OpenCL library by Pierre L’Ecuyer. Contributors for this package are Ruoyong Xu and Patrick Brown.
* [gpuBatchMatrix](https://github.com/ruoyongxu/gpuBatchMatrix): an R package that does several matrix operations that are useful in geostatistical model computations in batches on GPU in R. Contributors for this packages are Patrick Brown and Ruoyong Xu.
